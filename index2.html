                With the use of a forecasting machine learning model, data from two sources (Bureau of Labor Statistics and Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis) was ran through the model to help predict what the unemployment rate will be in December of 2022 or the next month, April 2021. Using the drop down tabs below, you may look through the steps taken by the team to better understand the process of predicting unemployment rates within the United States.

These two sources provided the foundation of the beginning of the predictions. Some of the categories being used in the predicitions are the historical unemployment rates from 2000 to 2021 recorded by race, gender, and education as seen below. This collected data was scraped from the websites using API keys and placed into a PostgreSQL database once cleaned. This process allowed for the data to be properly used in the following machine learning models.</p>

              <p align="left">With data that is continuous, it was important to utilize machine learning methods that would provide numerical results. The first model implemented was the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm. This particular model can be used for either linear regression or classification, however, for this prediction project the focus was on linear regression. The data collected from the API calls was split into training and testing sets to test the accuracy of the model. The first test with this model, as seen below, was using data from 2001 to attempt to predict the rates from 2002 in order to test the accuracy. It was discovered that the model was overfitting and could not predict future dates with the accuracy the project needed.

              <p align="left">Once it was decided that the first model, KNN, would not create an accurate predicition, a new method was selected. The next model explored was AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). This particular model utilizes a type of time series forecasting model. Forecasting is a popuilar machine learning method to use when predicting the future values the series in question will take. A time series can be of a yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, minutes, and seconds frequency. With unemployment rates being recorded monthly and yearly by most reporting agencies, this particular model best fits the current data sets available in structure. This particular type of machine learning also requires that data be stationary for best results when performing testing and training. The overall unemployment rates CSV file was used as the sample data for three main tests of the ARIMA method. In the initial test, it was found that the unemployment rates provided for the next twelve months were suspiciously high, ranging from six to seventeen percent. It is suspected that the team did not have a full understanding of the machine learning method to make appropriate adjustments. The second attempt was created following similar methods for predicting temperature, however, the model provided a consisent result of 6.7% for every month. When adjustments were made, the unemployment prediction produced was stationary at 3.9%. This percentage rate was in line with the historical data. However, the second test of the ARIMA model did not provide variation in results which leaves the team to believe that the model was not successful despite being within range of acceptable results and creating accurate testing and training scores. The final attempt using the ARIMA model could not be moved past the training and testing phase as it did not produce future predictions like the previous two attempts. Overall, the model seemed extremely promising based on the research performed, but did not meet the team's standards and expectations.

                <p align="left">After completing an exploration of the KNN and ARIMA machine learning models, it was discovered that both models had their pros and cons. The ARIMA model best fit the goals of the project itself. The model was built to predict similar concepts built around time frequencies. Yet, when the model was put through testing and training, the results proved too high or simply predicting the same percentage continuously. The KNN model on the other hand, did not have the same issues with predicting future unemployment rates. Testing the model proved to show a high accuracy. This high accuracy was a concern of being overfitting based on the single CSV file that was used for sample data. In both cases, more time and further research would provide a clearer picture of which model could accurately predict future unemployment rate in the United States based on a multitude of factors.
