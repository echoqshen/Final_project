# US Unemployment Analysis

## Introduction
####
Our team decided to analyze US unemployment data and focus on the data from the years 2000 - 2021. 

## Why was this topic selected? 
####

The team decided to focus on this topic due to the direct impact this type of event would have on NJ since we are all current residents and want to put our Data Science skills to the test in order to see how different factors .

## Our Roadmap
####
We collected data sets from the Bureau of Labor Statistics website (BLS) [https://www.bls.gov/data/], a national organization that provides data on labor market activity, working conditions, proice changes, and productivity in the US economy. Additionally, we examined datasets from The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis' Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/], which is one of the nation's leading trusted sources for economic data. The CSV files we retrieved contain 20+ years (2000-2021) of information which we feel is a sufficient historical view that can be leveraged in order to predict a future outcome. Some of the data columns that we are reviewing include data on educational levels, race, and gender. The plan is to utilize a Linear Regression model in order to quantify future unemployment rates and predict what the US national unemployment rate will be in general, as well as for each of the different variables, by December 2022.

## Technologies In Use
####
In this project we will be using the following: 
* PostgreSQL, 
* Pandas, 
* VSCode, 
* Jupyter Notebook, 
* PGAdmin, 
* MongoDB, 
* Python, and 
* machine learning. 
* Along with the physical code for the project, we have opted to use a branch protection rule within Github to make secure and accurate pull requests. This rule requires two individuals within the group to approve any pull requests that are submitted before the branches can be merged with the added updates. 


## Our Roadmap
The main question we would like to answer is which coastal state may be the most in danger of being submerged the soonest based on the data collected regarding rising sea levels. Since our data spans almost a decade, we intend to make a prediction into the next decade.

We plan to create an interactive map API to display how an area will be affected by the increase in sea level.

Another question we hope to explore is if sea level change has any correlation to global economic activity. Does human economic activity increase the sea level across the world in any way? Our intitial hypothesis is that there is NO correlation between them.


## Machine Learning Model
####
Because our prediction is a type of forecasting, the machine learning model that would best fit our needs might be a neural network model. This fits our project because we plan to use data from the previous two decades (2000-2021) and predict what the unemployment rate might be at year's end in December 2022.
